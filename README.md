Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing e-commerce transaction data using different data charts in R. The objective is to understand sales patterns, transaction distribution, and monthly sales trends through graphical representation.

Dataset Used
E-commerce Transactions Dataset

The dataset contains transaction dates and transaction amount details related to online sales.

Tools and Libraries Used
R Programming Language
RStudio
ggplot2
dplyr
lubridate

Charts Implemented

Histogram
A histogram is used to visualize the distribution of transaction amounts and identify common transaction ranges.

Boxplot
A boxplot is used to detect outliers in transaction amounts and understand data spread.

Heatmap
A heatmap represents monthly sales intensity based on aggregated transaction amounts, helping to identify high and low sales periods.

Learning Outcomes
Understanding e-commerce sales analysis through visualization
Ability to detect outliers and patterns in transaction data
Practical use of time-based data aggregation
Hands-on experience with ggplot2 and lubridate

Conclusion
The e-commerce data analysis using charts helps in identifying transaction amount distribution, detecting anomalies, and understanding monthly sales trends. Visualization simplifies complex transaction data and supports better decision-making.
